Sora The Troll decided to unlist his live videos but some people wants to see them, sometimes you might miss the livestream and want to see the playback, though Sora thinks lives should be lives only. 
But some people are experiencing difficulties so i need to help them as much as i can.

we can basically find playlists then share
like this site https://unlistedvideos.com/search.php?user=Sora%20The%20Troll

there is also some truth to what sora said, lives should be momentary. preserving everything makes no sense. it only should be done by computers. and usages only must be for mechanisms, for an average viewer there is probably no need to watch older videos. maybe some pressure of missing from society but not much.
it's really interesting to see that humans are so fragile
when we compare them to machines, human stupidity is in the open.

searching for the playlists isn't so easy. it's so random
doesn't seem to be a computer's job and whatever i do, it's always incomplete. i mean even if we did have everything it's inhuman to watch them all. maybe few exceptions
